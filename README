I am really proud of this project. It is one I collaborated on with three other new developers from my boot camp.
The interesting thing about the project is that covid-19 hit right as we started forcing us to develop the entire application remotely.
My own personal work was mostly focused on the form appearance and the API development/implementation for getting the form content sent to the java back-end of the program.
It is certainly the most complex code I have worked on to date and I made sure to work closely and peer program as much of the REST controllers 
as well as the class hierarchy as possible. I am proud of the work I did and also my efforts of collaboration.
